# TeamVotes
Voting site with absolutely no frameworks

## Information
This exercise was intentionally made without the use of any frameworks, including bootstrap or jquery.

## Assignment
The assignment was to create a site on which users could vote for their preferred team. Voting registered their information into the database, and each user (email-based) was allowed to vote only once. After voting, the user was taken into a confirmation page, which allowed them to tell a friend about the contest. Upon sending the email, the system registered and extra vote for the user. Only one extra vote was registered.

For the admins it was required to be able to see information about the voters, results for each team and the possibility to randomly get a winner or winners for the competition, based on which team they voted for.
